This repository contains an analysis of how different weather data is impacted by a city's latitude, and includes scatterplots with linear regression to display the relationships between these variables. Additionally, VacationPy is an analysis of which cities in the world would be closest to my "ideal" weather conditions and lists a hotel in each of those cities.
